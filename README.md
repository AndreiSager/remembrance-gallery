## My Goal With This Project

My goal was to simulate a professional work environment.

- I built this app using a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) [starter template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/image-gallery-starter), [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/transformation_reference) to manage the assets, and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for the styling.
- I worked with tasks on a Kanban board using [Todoist](https://todoist.com/): [Screenshot Of Archived Board](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfe84e7c-9938-4a0a-a72c-e1e5737c891f)
- I used feature branches and pull requests: [Pull Request Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6773d4ed-5648-465a-8035-cde7c3028c2d)

## Why I Built This Project This Way

I set myself the goal of creating a presentable gallery website within a 1-week timeframe, with the deadline being my grandfather's anniversary.

- I intentionally used a template that uses Tailwind with the Cloudinary API already built-in as I set velocity as the highest priority for this project.
- For styling I installed a linter called prettier that sorts the elements and tailwind classes automatically.

## If I Had More Time I Would Change These

- Modify the template to support Video items using Cloudinary API. 
- Contribute my changes to the starter template as a pull request. <!-- The support for Video items was already broken when I used the template. -->
- Add authentication with a content management UI to easily add items on the site instead of on Cloudinary. <!-- Use tailwind to create UI and Cloudinary API to manage images -->
- Mocking Cloudinary http requests using Jest. <!-- To avoid external dependencies -->
